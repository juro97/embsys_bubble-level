INCLUDE\+\_\+x\+Task\+Abort\+Delay must be defined as 1 in Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h for this function to be available.

A task will enter the Blocked state when it is waiting for an event. The event it is waiting for can be a temporal event (waiting for a time), such as when \mbox{\hyperlink{nucleo-l432c__piezo-beeper_2_switch_buzz_2_middlewares_2_third___party_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2task_8h_aa154068cecd7f31446a7a84af44ab1a3}{v\+Task\+Delay()}} is called, or an event on an object, such as when \mbox{\hyperlink{nucleo-l432c__piezo-beeper_2_switch_buzz_2_middlewares_2_third___party_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2queue_8h_ae8364d988c6f9b63c771cc2b3dfe5df9}{x\+Queue\+Receive()}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{nucleo-l432c__piezo-beeper_2_switch_buzz_2_middlewares_2_third___party_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2task_8h_a66540bef602522a01a519f776e4c07d8}{ul\+Task\+Notify\+Take()}} is called. If the handle of a task that is in the Blocked state is used in a call to \mbox{\hyperlink{nucleo-l432c__piezo-beeper_2_switch_buzz_2_middlewares_2_third___party_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2task_8h_afefe333df0492c8411c0094badd25185}{x\+Task\+Abort\+Delay()}} then the task will leave the Blocked state, and return from whichever function call placed the task into the Blocked state.

There is no \textquotesingle{}From\+ISR\textquotesingle{} version of this function as an interrupt would need to know which object a task was blocked on in order to know which actions to take. For example, if the task was blocked on a queue the interrupt handler would then need to know if the queue was locked.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Task} & The handle of the task to remove from the Blocked state.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the task referenced by x\+Task was not in the Blocked state then pd\+FAIL is returned. Otherwise pd\+PASS is returned.
