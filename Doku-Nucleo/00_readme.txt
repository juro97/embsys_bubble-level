== 01_Nucleo_L432KC_Pinout.png

Evaluation Board Pinout and peripheral IO mapping.

== 02_Nucleo_L432KC_Evaluation_Board.pdf

This PDF document contains the schematics and description of the Nucleo L432kC
evaluation board.

[TIP]
Have the schematics at hand. You will probably require it multiple times 
during this class.

== 03_STM32L432KC_Reference-Manual.pdf

This document describes all the peripherals - you'll find here all registers,
their purpose and how certain bits in every register affect respective 
functionality. 

[TIP]
When using the HAL API you'll only infrequently need to access this document, 
however, for barebones programming this document is the primary source.

== 04_STM32L4_HAL-API.pdf

This manual describes the hardware abstraction layer and the respective 
application programmers interface. 

[TIP]
This document complements the source code provided by STM32. You may either 
browse the source code and read the comments found therein or use this manual.

== 05_STM32L432KC_Erratasheet.pdf

In this document you will find silicon bugs and (hopefully) some workarounds.

== 06_STM32L432KC_MCU_Datasheet.pdf

This document contains electrical device information that is usually required
when designing your own PCB. 

== 07_STM32_CortexM4-Core_Programmers-Manual.pdf

This PDF document contains the programmers manual of the Cortex-M4 processor 
core. In particular, you will find things like the memory map (required when 
writing your own linker script), the exeception and vector table, CMSIS 
intrinsic functions (disabling/enabling IRQs, sleep modes etc.) and, a 
description of the supported assembly instructions.
